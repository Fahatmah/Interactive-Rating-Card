### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  SCSS
-  Flexbox
-  Javascript

### What I learned

As a newbie in Web Development, it was overwhelming when I started to learn Javascript after HTML and CSS. And it was not easy, I always search and watch a lot of videos in Youtube or read in W3Schools. But I have learned basics of JS for now, and I eagerly want to learn more but my brain can not :D

I want to add more functions in the component but need to learn it first. And atleast for now, I met the requirements of this project.
